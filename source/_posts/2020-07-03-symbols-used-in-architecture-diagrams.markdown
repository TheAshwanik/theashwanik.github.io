Sometime back I was looking for these standard #symbols to demonstrate level of change for each system and interface.    
The key to the symbols used in attached to each of the overall #technical #architecture #diagrams and a full definition is given in this article.    
<!-- more -->

Some of the following symbols are used in the architecture diagrams (there can be more).

The Architecture diagrams show the level of change for each system and interface. The key to the symbols used in attached to each of the overall architecture diagrams and a full definition is given below.     

This application of these symbols applies to the particular diagram. For example, a system that is removed from the provisioning interface but still exists for Billing will be shown as functionally changed at the project level, removed for provisioning and unchanged for Billing.    

Marking of text only applies to new or removed parameters within a message in the flow diagrams for a changed message.
