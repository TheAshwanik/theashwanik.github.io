    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello again, This time I wrote an octopress plugin which will upload the files from your local directory to your
S3 account and provide you a tag which you can refer in your html views.</p>

<p>The uploading takes place at the time <!--more--> of generating your site with the help of security credentials
from your ENV variables settings.</p>

<p>You can get the source at github here: <a href="https://github.com/TheAshwanik/aws_s3_imagetag">aws_s3_imagetag</a></p>

<p>This is how you can setup:</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/TheAshwanik/aws_s3_imagetag">aws_s3_imagetag</a></h4>

<p>An octopress plugin to upload files to AWS S3 account and Provide a tag to reference the files in your views.</p>

<p>Place your files under the directory defined as your env variable S3_DIR (see enviroment variables below). When you generate your site the files will be
uploaded to your S3 AWS account. and then you can use the tag 'AWS_S3_Image' which allows you reference images we just hosted on Amazon S3
within your posts.  A bit of a contrived example, but it demonstrates the process of creating custom Liquid tags.</p>

<p>To use it, just host some place some images in $S3_DIR (they will be made publicly accessible) and use the tag with the syntax</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you don't specify a bucket name and folder name in the view, it will look for an environment variable.</p>

<h4>Environment Variable</h4>

<p>(I did not want to expose the credential by accendently checking in the code, so using ENV variables )</p>

<pre><code>export AWS_BUCKET=your bucket name     

\# if your images are under a folder inside the bucket  
export AWS_BUCKET_FOLDER=folder name               

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=Your S3 Access Key     

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Your S3 Secret key     

\# Directory from where the files will be uploaded   
export S3_DIR=source/images/TO_S3                   

\# set false if you dont want to upload and just use the tag to refer s3 images/files    
export AWS_UPLOAD=true                            
</code></pre>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p></p>

<p># If you want to avoid referencing the annoyingly long aws s3 url, you can set your custom domain url
and set it as an env variable</p>

<pre><code>export AWS_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=pics.mydomain.com   
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the final html will have image tag as <br/>
\<img src="http://pics.mydomain.com/folder/image.jpg"></p>

<p>And you can avoid the URLs in form of  <br/>
\<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/folder/image.jpg"></p>

<p>You will have to set up CNAME entry for your domain name , I will cover that in another post.</p>
