    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi Friends,<br/>
I could not write anything for last few weeks, had been busy with usual chores and a weekend project with my brother(about which you will come to know, when we bring it to a better shape).</p>

<p>But I am back , and would try to be consistent.</p>

<p>Promise.</p>

<p>This post is to let you know a little trick that I am gonna start following, many of you may already be following it.</p>

<p>Ever wanted to have your users contact you for random issues, or just let them contact you for their queries,
and you have to create a contact_us or feedback page.  Well I would like to share with you , what I had found,
a neat little trick which uses github repo as a feedback page.</p>

<p>Go ahead have a look, click on the button and leave me a feedback or queries or questions, I would try to answer them as quickly as I can.</p>

<p><a class="btn btn-mini btn-info" href="https://github.com/TheAshwaniK/Feedback/issues/new" title="Leave Ashwani feedback using GitHub" target="_blank"><i class="icon-comment icon-white"></i> Leave me feedback</a></p>

<p>Or click this url:
<a href="https://github.com/TheAshwaniK/Feedback/issues/new">https://github.com/TheAshwaniK/Feedback/issues/new</a></p>

<p>Why Github Repo?? <br/>
So I can keep track of what I have been doing, and addressing your concerns as well.</p>

<p>That's it folks.
Catch you soon.</p>
