    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Is grep Slow?   Sure it is. Read on..
Just a few days back there was an electrical outage and lot of applications were dead. <br/>
In one case, lot of customer orders could   <!--more--> not be processed.
Hence, there rose a need of manual intervention and extraction of orders (XML) from a logfile and re-feeding them to another system.
The task was simple, I had order numbers in orders.txt  and I had to write a shell script to grep for a particular
xml containing each of these orders, extract XML and create a file for each order.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Shell script to loop and find an order in another file</span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h2>cat extract.sh&lt;/h2>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>i=0
</span><span class='line'>echo "Extraction Script Started at:" &lt;code>date&lt;/code>
</span><span class='line'>while read order_id; do
</span><span class='line'>    filename=$order_id"_tmp.xml"
</span><span class='line'>    finalfilename=$order_id".xml"
</span><span class='line'>    grep ".&lt;em>$order_id." &lt;/em>.log > $filename &amp;&amp; echo "written xml for $order_id in $filename" || echo $order_id >> Orders_not_found.txt
</span><span class='line'>    cat $filename | sed -e 's|text-to-remove|new-text|g' | sed -e 's|***||g' > $finalfilename
</span><span class='line'>    rm $filename
</span><span class='line'>    ((i++))
</span><span class='line'>done &lt; orders.txt
</span><span class='line'>echo "Extraction Script Ended at:" &lt;code>date&lt;/code></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>But the problem was that the log file in which I was searching was too huge. It was 5GBs in total.
Hence the grep was taking minimum 4-5 Minutes to search one order and create an xml file for that.
Clearly this was not a solution, as I had to find thousand orders in those log files and it was very critical for end customer.</p>

<p>If my calulation was right, I had to spend:  <br/>
4 Mins = 1 Xml  <br/>
60 Mins = 1 Hr = 15 Xml  <br/>
at this rate I would have spent atleast 3-4 days CPU time , to get all those 1000 XMLs.
(Not to mention the pain of getting screwed and frustration). Meaning which, we all would have been screwed
over and over again for 3-4 days by the customer.</p>

<p><b>Enter Ruby:</b>
One liner saved us.  <br/>
I used this ruby command, to first find the relevant generic string then create order xml files using a normal shell
script as above. I thought I would keep this fir future reference.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ ruby -pe 'next unless $_ =~ /&lt;RegExp for stringtomatch>.&lt;em>Number.&lt;/em>/' &lt; 5GB-file.log >> 6Mb-file-reduced.log</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Wondereful, Ruby took just few minutes to grep the regular exp string into a 5GB log file, and now I had to search orders
into this smaller reduced size intermediate file.</p>

<p>Thus, this saved us 3 days and did wonders in just half an hour.</p>

<p>Voila !!!</p>

<p>Credit for the one liner goes to <a href="http://axonflux.com/handy-ruby-one-liners-by-david-thomas">Garry Tan</a>, where I found this wonderful ruby command.</p>

    <id>http://blog.ashwani.co.in/blog/2013-11-10/instant-nokogiri-book-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Guys, Recently I was requested to review a book by <a href="http://hunterpowers.com/">Hunter Powers</a>.
The book is titled as "<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/utilize-information-available-on-internet-using-Nokogiri/book">Instant Nokogiri</a>'.</p>

<p>So here are my unbiased thought on the same:</p>

<p><a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> - is an HTML, XML, SAX, &amp; Reader <!--more--> parser with the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors… and much more</p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/utilize-information-available-on-internet-using-Nokogiri/book">
<img class="left_aligned_image" src="/assets/Nokogiri.JPG" width="350" height="350" title="Instant Nokogiri" alt="Instant Nokogiri image">
</a></p>

<p><strong>This book is in its simplest and easiest form, explains the basics of Nokogiri in a layman's language.<br/>
A definite read for all those who love simplicity and awesomeness of ruby language.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Book is in interest of those new-comers who would like to learn scraping data from 'websites/other sources' which does not provide a developer API.</strong></p>

<p>It does not have any fancy graphics, no vague examples etc. It just dives into the real subject , which is what a beginner (or expert for that matter)
would require to get started or master Nokogiri.</p>

<p>With very subtle examples of data scraping and clear understanding, the author makes a newbee feel like they already
know how Nokogiri works.</p>

<p>The section "Top 13 features you need to know about" clearly explains some of the not known features of Nokogiri.
My favorite parts are about "Spoofing browser agents"  and "Mechanize".</p>

<p>All in all this is perfect book for beginners. But if you are an expert ruby developer and use nokogiri extensively,
this book may not be for you.</p>

<p><strong><u>For a first time user, I definitely recommend this book.</u></strong></p>
